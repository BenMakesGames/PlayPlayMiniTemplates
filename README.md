# PlayPlayMini Templates

This is a collection of templates for [PlayPlayMini](https://github.com/BenMakesGames/PlayPlayMini).

The available templates are:
1. `playplaymini.skeleton`
   * A basic PlayPlayMini project, with no other dependencies.
   * Creates a template `Startup` and `Playing` game state to help you get started.
2. `playplaymini.serilog`
   * Based on `playplaymini.skeleton`, and adds Serilog to log exceptions, and other information.
3. `playplaymini.steam`
    * Based on `playplaymini.skeleton`, and adds Steamworks.NET, Serilog, and a Powershell build script.
    * Does NOT come bundled with `steam_api64.dll` - you must download this file from Valve.
